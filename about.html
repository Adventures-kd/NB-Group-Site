        <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-2">History</h3>
        <div class="lead"><p>NB Group began in the foothills of the Himalayas in the 1950s, though the name did not exist back then. A small village farmer boy in Barhabise, Sindupalchowk by the name of Narsingh Bahadur began trade with Tibet. Salt, sheep and wool was imported from Tibet whereas wheat, rice, sugar and spices were exported. This trade enterprise was essentially the first rudimentary seeds of what would later grow to become NB Group.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">In the 1960s and 70s, trade was progressively expanded to other nations like Japan and Hong Kong and included various other products such as herbs and handicraft. During late 70s and early 80s, the first seeds of trade with Bangladesh began with the export of railway sleepers and red lentil seeds. Trade with Bangladesh would later culminate with the establishment of Nepal Bangladesh Bank.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">During the 80s, NB Group was exposed to the national arena while supplying fertilizers to the Government of Nepal through global tenders. It was during this epoch of time that NB Group stepped into the representation and liaison business by representing various foreign firms. The 80s also brought about NB Group into the industrial sector where the group successfully won the bid for privatization of Nepal's largest brick factory, under the first phase of the governmental privatization program. The group then went on to acquire another brick factory, a cold storage facility and saw mills among others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The 90s saw the group's major shift in business sector as they moved from traditional industry to the financial and tertiary sector. In a joint venture with IFIC Bank of Bangladesh, NB Group promoted and established Nepal Bangladesh Bank which was successively followed by a finance company NB Finance and Leasing. A few years later, NB Group once again in a joint venture with Bank of Ceylon, promoted and established another commercial bank Nepal Bank of Ceylon (Later changed to Nepal Credit and Commerce Bank) and a merchant bank Nepal Sri Lanka Merchant Bank in a joint venture with MBSL of Sri Lanka.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The late 90s and early 2000s saw the establishment of the first fully private sector Hydro power plant of Nepal. NB Group pioneered this project in a joint venture with Lyse Kraft AS of Norway. The Group is now in the process of establishing new projects in the hospitality and the health sector. With investments in well diversified industries and having generated employment for over 3000 jobs, NB Group today stands as one of the foremost business houses of Nepal.&nbsp;</span><br></p></div>
